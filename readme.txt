Featured Post Plugin for WordPress with custom post type support.

== Description ==

**CodeFlavors Featured Post** allows you to feature any WordPress post type into posts and pages by using the shortcode implemented by the plugin. Besides the featured posts shortcode, the plugin implements a widget that does the exact same thing. 

To display featured posts into the front-end the plugin uses the templates it implements (by default, only 2 are available»ò Fancy and Default) and also offers the possibility to create custom templates that can be used to display the featured posts.

Features:

* Feature any post type;
* Plenty of options for choosing posts (post type, taxonomy, number of posts, skipped posts, template);
* Compatible with Visual Composer;
* Compatible with any WordPress theme;
* Feature posts by using the shortcode or the widget;
* TinyMCE editor interface for choosing featured posts.
